    Problem: People in a workplace often have to tell eachother whether they
    commit a chunk of code, open an issue/ticket or create a merge request.

    We had this problem in our team which was literally painful. We were using
    <a href="https://www.assembla.com/home" target="__blank">
      {' Assembla '}
    </a>
    for Version Control at first but switched to
    <a href="https://www.gitlab.com/" target="__blank">
      {' Gitlab '}
    </a>
    after sometime.
    <br />
    <br />
    Solution: What I did was, created a bot for Skype and Telegram which
    notifies everyone when anyone do any git operation.
    <br />
    PS: Why Telegram? Because I prefer it on any other platform ðŸ˜›
